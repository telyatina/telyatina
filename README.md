- Hi everyone, I’m @telyatina (Natalia actually, but if you call me telyatina - it's okay. It means `veal` in Russian by the way, and French seem to think that this word is the most beautiful one in Russian. 
- I’m interested in changing my career path towards Data Analysis. Currently I am a Translator (Eng/Fr/Rus).
- I got interested in DA due to COVID and all the discussions unfolded around data analysis, clinical trials and statistics.
- I completed (Feb-22 - Aug-22) a 6-month Data Analysis programme at Yandex.Practicum: I am now uploading the projects I made while studying.
- I’m currently learning Python, statistics, SQL, Clickhouse, ML basics.
